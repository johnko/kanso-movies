## Because music sounds better on a Couch

Still in early dev.

## Requirements

* CouchDB >=0.11 with couchdb-lucene (mapped as http://myhost.com/mydb/_fti)
* Couchapp >=0.4 (for app installation)
* Adobe AIR runtime (for music importation)

Normally any HTML5-compliant browser can use the application. Tested on 
Safari 5, Firefox 3.6 can't read the MP3 from Couchdb!?
