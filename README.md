# Cloudbox

__Cloudbox is a cloudy jukebox (hence the name)__

Actually, it's a couchapp using HTML5's video tag. In the back-end the basic principle is "a video = a couchDB document".

Movies on a couch... relaxing ;)

## Requirements

* CouchDB >=0.11 with couchdb-lucene (mapped as http://myhost/mydb/_fti)
* Couchapp >=0.6
